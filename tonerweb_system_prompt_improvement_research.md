## Conclusion

The current TonerWeb AI system prompt provides excellent coverage for printer consumables but captures less than 20% of tonerweb.no's total product catalog. The **Hybrid Expansion Strategy** (Approach 6) with the recommended phased implementation offers the best balance of improved coverage, manageable complexity, and measurable progress.

Priority should be given to:
1. **Enhanced Norwegian terminology** for immediate improvements
2. **Office products expansion** for the largest coverage gain
3. **Complete catalog integration** for comprehensive service

This approach can increase tonerweb.no coverage from ~20% to ~95% while maintaining the system's current strengths in printer product expertise.
