   - Performance benchmarks and success metrics

## ðŸ“‹ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Backup Current System (5 minutes)
```bash
# Backup current files
cp server/perplexity.ts server/perplexity_backup.ts
cp server/gemini.ts server/gemini_backup.ts
```

### Step 2: Deploy Enhanced Prompts (10 minutes)
```bash
# Replace with enhanced versions
cp server/perplexity_enhanced.ts server/perplexity.ts
cp server/gemini_enhanced.ts server/gemini.ts
```

### Step 3: Test Core Functionality (15 minutes)
```bash
# Test that services start without errors
npm run dev

# Test basic printer functionality (regression test)
# Test: "Canon PG-540 blekkpatron"
# Expected: Should work exactly as before

# Test new office functionality
# Test: "Trenger en god kulepenn"
# Expected: Should find office supply products, not printer products
```

### Step 4: Run PoC Test Suite (30 minutes)
- Execute test scenarios from `poc_test_scenarios.md`
- Document results and success rates
- Validate URL accuracy and response quality

### Step 5: Rollback Plan (if needed)
```bash
# If issues occur, quick rollback
cp server/perplexity_backup.ts server/perplexity.ts
cp server/gemini_backup.ts server/gemini.ts
```
